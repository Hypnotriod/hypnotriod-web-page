<p>
	We (Wide Vibe Records team) are pleased to present you this new EP of four original tracks produced by flutist Ilya Pikin aka Hypnotriod.
</p>
<p>
	This unique release has absorbed various styles of progressive electronic music expressed by power of analogue synthesizers and spiced with gentle melodies of ethnic woodwinds.
</p>
<p>
	Deep inside, it fills you with the electricity of the sky, the songs of forest ghosts, the rage of flame – and lets you fly high.
